# Visualizing Pittsburgh’s Birds in Sound and Space - Final Project Part I 
## Outline

This project looks at five of the most common bird species in Pittsburgh and explores how their songs can be transformed into forms that are both visible and comparable. Bird calls are everywhere in our daily lives, but they are often dismissed as background noise.

I chose this topic because listening to birds has always felt both familiar and calming. When I hear a robin or cardinal outside my window, I notice the rise and fall of their notes, but I cannot confidently say which bird is which. That uncertainty made me curious: could visual translation bridge the gap between what we hear and what we know? My goak is to create a visual dictionary of calls, one that highlights not only the shape of a single song but also the variety within each species.

To achieve this, the project does not rely on pre-made spectrogram images but instead begins with the raw sounds themselves. Each recording is broken down into thousands of individual points that capture time, frequency, and intensity, and these points are then reconstructed in Tableau. The result looks similar to a spectrogram, but it is a dataset-driven visualization that can be filtered, reshaped, and directly compared. This approach makes the act of listening more accessible—moving away from a static format meant for specialists and toward a visual form that is open to a broader audience.

From there, the points are organized into distinct “singing styles,” such as the clear notes of a Phrase, the rapid repetitions of a Series, the fluid tones of a Warble, and the quick, even beat of a Trill. These categories, drawn from Nathan Pieplow’s framework for describing birdsong patterns (Pieplow 2009), provide a bridge between technical audio data and a more intuitive, musical understanding. Beyond single examples, the project also works on two levels of comparison: across species, where Pittsburgh’s five common birds can be set side by side; and within species, where different song types are separated and displayed to reveal the richness and variation of a single voice.

Paired with maps that show where these birds are found in Pittsburgh, the project brings together sound and place, hearing and seeing. It is an invitation to slow down, pay attention, and discover how much life is carried in the voices around us. By using data visualization to uncover the hidden patterns within these songs, I hope to encourage a deeper connection to the natural world that exists right outside our windows.

## One-Sentence Summary

My story aims to demonstrate how the songs of Pittsburgh’s most common birds can be transformed from fleeting sounds into visual data, making it easier for people to see differences, identify species, and understand where these birds live.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
