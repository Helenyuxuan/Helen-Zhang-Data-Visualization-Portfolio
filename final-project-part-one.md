# Visualizing Pittsburgh’s Birds in Sound and Space - Final Project Part I 
## Outline

This project looks at five of the most common bird species in Pittsburgh and explores how their songs can be transformed into forms that are both visible and comparable. Bird calls are everywhere in our daily lives, but they are often dismissed as background noise. Personally, I like to pause and listen when I hear birds, so I can hear differences in tone or rhythm, but struggle to connect those distinctions to a specific species. This project aims to bridge that gap between hearing and knowing by turning recordings into data-driven visualizations.

I chose this topic because listening to birds has always felt both familiar and frustrating. When I hear a robin or cardinal outside my window, I notice the rise and fall of their notes, but I cannot confidently say which bird is which. That uncertainty made me curious: could visual translation bridge the gap between what we hear and what we know? My aim is to create a visual dictionary of calls, one that highlights not only the shape of a single song but also the variety within each species.

To achieve this, the project will translate the complex, scientific language of bird spectrograms into an intuitive, musical notation. While a spectrogram provides a precise record of a bird’s song, its abstract, graphical nature is not immediately understandable to the average person. By analyzing recordings and identifying distinct "singing styles"—such as the clear notes of a Phrase, the rapid repetitions of a Series, the fluid tones of a Warble, and the quick, even beat of a Trill—I will build a way of seeing sound that makes those distinctions clearer.

Paired with maps that show where these birds are found in Pittsburgh, the project brings together sound and place, hearing and seeing. It is not only an exercise in analysis but also an invitation to slow down, pay attention, and discover how much life is carried in the voices around us. By using data visualization to uncover the hidden patterns within these songs, I hope to encourage a deeper connection to the natural world that exists right outside our windows.


> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
