# Wireframes / storyboards
My storyboard lays out the progression of the project in a clear, sequential way. The narrative begins with a county-wide overview, using bar charts to identify the five most frequently observed bird species in Allegheny County. From there, the story narrows in on each individual species. For the Northern Cardinal, which I have developed first(TOP 1 observed bird), the section includes a brief introduction, a location map showing where it is most often recorded, and a visualization of its songs that reconstructs the sound as data points in Tableau.

The full project will apply this same structure to all five species, ensuring that each one is represented with consistent visual elements: an introduction, a distribution map, and a visualization of song styles. There will be additional visualization that show changes in recorded observations across seasons and years, connecting individual birds back to larger ecological patterns.

This storyboard structure is logically presented, moving from the broad (all county records) to the specific (individual birds), and it provides a sufficient number of visualizations to tell a compelling story. By adopting a sketchbook-like style, the project makes bird data approachable for casual audiences—birdwatchers, students, or local residents—so the visuals do not just inform but invite curiosity. This combination of outline, draft data visualizations, and audience framing meets the requirements for a clear, engaging storyboard.

## Design: data visualizations

For this project, I have identified several key visualizations that will guide the reader through the story of Pittsburgh’s five most common birds. Each visualization is designed to connect sound, space, and species, making the patterns of birdsong more intuitive and engaging.

- **Top 5 Most Observed Species (Bar Chart)**  
  A bar chart ranking the five most commonly observed bird species in Allegheny County. This sets the stage by establishing which species are most present in daily life.<img width="1296" height="620" alt="截屏2025-10-02 下午6 56 56" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ce701c8-94cb-460c-8a66-029271f20be3" />

**Using the Northern Cardinal as an example, the other four species will follow the same format.**

- **Species Profile: Northern Cardinal (Sample Page)**
A focused profile that blends text, imagery. Features a short descriptive narrative, scientific details, and a clear visual identity (color, photo, or icon).<img width="1451" height="853" alt="截屏2025-10-02 下午6 59 57" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42917b53-a045-404c-b989-7a6dc05afbdc" />
**Note:** Explanations of bird sound visualization categories (e.g., **trill**, **series**, **musical vs. non-musical tones**...) are based on resources from *Earbirding* (Earbirding, *The Four Basic Patterns of Repetition and Speed*).

- **Species Distribution Map (Map in Tableau)**  
  A map showing where each species has been recorded across Allegheny County. Different colors represent different species, giving a geographic context to where these birds can be found.<img width="1294" height="793" alt="截屏2025-10-02 下午6 59 37" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d98ad762-46f8-4e7c-9a54-777aff7ddb6c" />

- **Still deciding to include or not :Yearly Observation Trends (Line Chart)**  
A time-series view of reported observations across years. While this doesn’t directly measure population size—since the same bird can be observed multiple times—it matters because it shows when and how people most often encounter these birds. The rhythm of reporting reflects both the birds’ seasonal activity and our habits of noticing them. This temporal perspective sets the stage for sound visualizations, where we shift from when we see them to how we hear them.<img width="807" height="769" alt="截屏2025-10-02 下午7 29 44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad61520a-806c-44a1-83ed-31a7d9551fd2" />


- **Song Visualization (Spectrogram-based Graphs)**  
  Each bird’s song is translated into a dataset of frequency, time, and intensity points, reconstructed in Tableau. These graphs make calls visible and allow comparisons across different song types within each species (Phrase, Series, Warble, Trill).<img width="960" height="755" alt="截屏2025-10-02 下午7 02 56" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f4880d3-00d0-4090-9806-b7ae5708be1f" />
<img width="1112" height="747" alt="截屏2025-10-02 下午7 32 35" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf5eaf8-82fe-47af-b239-a30995603b62" />


# User research 

## Target Audience  

The target audience for this project is the broader Pittsburgh community, particularly people who hear birds daily but do not necessarily recognize them by sound or appearance. This includes casual park visitors, city residents with backyard feeders, and students or educators who want accessible, visual ways to learn about local species.  

To make the research representative, I identified three groups to focus on:  

1. **Beginner birdwatchers** – people who may notice birds but struggle to match calls with species.  
2. **Local residents** – individuals who encounter birds in parks and neighborhoods but usually treat them as background noise.  
3. **Curious learners** – students and educators interested in combining nature and data visualization in more playful, sketchbook-like ways.  

This choice ensures that the design of data visualizations—maps, song reconstructions, and observation trends—remains both accurate and approachable. Titles, annotations, legends, captions, and sources are added not only for precision but also to keep the project open and engaging for non-specialists.
