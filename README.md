# About me 

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e66e429c-a1ee-400d-a924-c8d6c1c57df7" alt="Helen Zhang" width="180"/>

Hi! My name is Helen Zhang. I am a second-year Master of Arts Management student at CMU, and I studied Jewelry and Metalsmithing at RISD for my undergraduate degree.


# What I hope to learn

1. I hope to apply my aesthetic sense of form and composition to data, creating visualizations that are not only functional but also visually compelling.
2. I want to develop my own design language.
3. I want to learn how to simplify complex information without losing information, so the story stays both accessible and accurate

# What I am planning to do after graduate
After I graduate, I plan to work in art administration across galleries and art fairs. In the next few years I expect to be based in Hong Kong, focusing on exhibition production, artist relations, and partnerships. I hope to bring my design sensibility from RISD and management training from CMU to build programs that connect artists with audiences.

# My Work

### [Government Debt Visualization](dataviz-examples.md)  
  An analysis of OECD government debt data, presented with a table using conditional formatting and red-flag thresholds to highlight countries with high debt-to-GDP ratios.  

### [Exploring Whisky Through Data](dataviz-examples-Whisky.md)  
  A series of visualizations examining whisky by age, price, region, and flavor. The project explores how cost relates to aging, whether regions cluster by flavor profile, and how simple comparisons (e.g., age vs. price, smokiness vs. region) reveal meaningful patterns.  

### [Critique by Design](critique-by-design.md)  
  A critique of an existing visualization and a redesign proposal using metaphor and map-based storytelling.
