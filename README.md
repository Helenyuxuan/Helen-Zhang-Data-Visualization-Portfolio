# Helen Zhang â€“ Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio documents my work for the **Telling Stories with Data** course.  

# About me
Hi! My name is **Helen Zhang**. I am a second-year Master of Arts Management student at CMU, and I studied Jewelry and Metalsmithing at RISD for my undergraduate degree.

# What I hope to learn
1. I hope to apply my aesthetic sense of form and composition to data, creating visualizations that are not only functional but also visually compelling.
2. I want to develop my own design language.
3. I want to learn how to simplify complex information without losing information, so the story stays both accessible and accurate

# What I am planning to do after graduate
After I graduate, I plan to work in art administration across galleries and art fairs. In the next few years I expect to be based in Hong Kong, focusing on exhibition production, artist relations, and partnerships. I hope to bring my design sensibility from RISD and management training from CMU to build programs that connect artists with audiences.

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
