# Helen Zhang â€“ Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio documents my work for the **Telling Stories with Data** course.  

# About me
Hi! My name is **Helen Zhang**. I am a second-year Master of Arts Management student at CMU, and I studied Jewelry and Metalsmithing at RISD for my undergraduate degree.

# What I hope to learn
1. I hope to apply my aesthetic sense of form and composition to data, creating visualizations that are not only functional but also visually compelling.
2. I want to develop my own design language.
3. I want to learn how to simplify complex information without losing information, so the story stays both accessible and accurate

# What I am planning to do after graduate
After I graduate, I plan to work in art administration across galleries and art fairs. In the next few years I expect to be based in Hong Kong, focusing on exhibition production, artist relations, and partnerships. I hope to bring my design sensibility from RISD and management training from CMU to build programs that connect artists with audiences.
